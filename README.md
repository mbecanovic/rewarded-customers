First commit was a demo API (read the commit).

Next step, potentially, is upgrading API to use SOAP Service for simpler manipulating with data which are stored on cloud. 
Also, this API will need an update to enforce a limit on agents actions, preventing each agent from rewarding more than five customers per day for one week.
(The README file will be edited after these changes)
